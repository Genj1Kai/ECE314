Problem 1: -5

You should derive when F>1, i.e., when 𝑆/𝑛>1/𝑐, the number of infected nodes tends to increase; when 𝐹<1, i.e., when 𝑆/𝑛<1/𝑐, the number of infected nodes tends to decrease.

Problem 2.2: -4

You should solve this problem theoretically like problem 1 and derive turnaround time being 𝑆/𝑛 > 𝛾/𝑐. Also, it takes less time to reach the turnaround point with a smaller gamma.
